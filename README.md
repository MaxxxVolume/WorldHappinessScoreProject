# Project: Analysis of the World Happiness Score (2024) with implementation of a Machine-Learning Model to predict the Future Life Ladder

This is my first "Data-Science-Related" Project.
The intention of this project is to analyze the Dataset first and detecting correlations, cleaning the data and preparing it for machine learning.
Aferwards different Machine Learning Models will be implemented and tested including decision trees and forests, pipelines and xgboost.

Unfortunately the map cannot be rendered in the Notebook itself so if you want to check out an interactive worldmap regarding the world happiness score,
